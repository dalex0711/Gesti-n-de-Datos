# Data Management

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use advanced JavaScript data structures and iteration methods in a practical and visual way. It focuses on displaying data stored in an object, a set, and a map by applying common loops and iteration techniques.

The implementation shows how to work with real data and present it clearly on a web page using the DOM, instead of logging it to the console.

## What This Project Covers

- Creation of a product catalog using an **object**.
- Elimination of duplicate entries by converting the object data into a **Set**.
- Organization of categories and product relationships using a **Map**.
- Use of three iteration methods:
  - `for...in` for objects
  - `for...of` for sets
  - `forEach()` for maps

Each structure is rendered in its own visual section using HTML and styled with CSS for clarity.

## Technical Highlights

- **Object:** Used to define and store a collection of products, each with an `id`, `name`, and `price`.
- **Set:** Ensures all products are unique and allows for clean iteration over product entries.
- **Map:** Links product categories to specific items, allowing category-based mapping.

## Display and Interaction

The data is presented directly in the browser through three distinct sections:
- **Product Catalog:** Displays the object entries using `for...in`.
- **Unique Products:** Shows the set entries using `for...of`.
- **Category Mapping:** Renders the map entries using `forEach()`.

The JavaScript code dynamically creates HTML elements to show this data, improving readability and user experience.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 
- CSS3 
- JavaScript

## Notes on Best Practices

- Clean use of `const` and `let` for variable declarations.
- Proper indentation and code organization.
- Descriptive class names and modular CSS.
- Script is well-structured and easy to understand.

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. No external tools or dependencies are required.
